# Object Detection

## Task: Implement an object detector which identifies the classes of the objects in an image or video.

To execute this, download this directory and run one of the detector files.

To run these files, you need Python 3, OpenCV and Numpy.

detector.py runs an image-based classifier
detector2.py runs a video-based classifier that classifies on real time feed from your webcam.
